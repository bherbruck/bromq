# yaml-language-server: $schema=https://github.com/bherbruck/bromq/releases/latest/download/bromq-config.schema.json
# BroMQ Configuration File
#
# This file is used to provision MQTT users and ACL rules.
# The configuration is synced to the database on every startup.
# This file is the source of truth for provisioned items (like Grafana provisioning).
#
# Environment Variable Interpolation (Docker Compose style):
#   ${VAR}           - Expand env var (empty string if unset)
#   ${VAR:-default}  - Expand env var with default value
#   ${username}      - Reserved ACL placeholder (NOT expanded)
#   ${clientid}      - Reserved ACL placeholder (NOT expanded)
#   $${...}          - Escaped, becomes literal ${...} (for JavaScript templates)
#
# Examples:
#   password: ${DB_PASSWORD}                    # Required env var
#   host: ${MQTT_HOST:-mqtt.example.com}       # With default
#   topic: "user/${username}/data"              # ACL placeholder (preserved)
#   content: |
#     const key = "${API_KEY}";                  # Env var in script
#     const topic = `device/$${id}/status`;      # JS template (escaped with $$)
#
# Usage:
#   ./bromq -config config.yml
#   Or set CONFIG_FILE environment variable:
#   CONFIG_FILE=/etc/bromq/config.yml ./bromq

# MQTT Users (device credentials for MQTT connections)
# These are NOT dashboard admin users - they are for MQTT client authentication
users:
  # Basic user with environment variable password

# ACL Rules (topic access control)
# Rules reference users by username and define topic patterns with permissions
acl_rules:
  # ===== Sensor User Rules =====
  # Sensors can publish/subscribe to their own namespace using ${username} placeholder
  - username: sensor_user
    topic: "sensors/${username}/#"
    permission: pubsub

  # Sensors can publish telemetry using ${clientid} placeholder (per-device isolation)
  - username: sensor_user
    topic: "telemetry/${clientid}/data"
    permission: pub

  # Sensors can subscribe to commands for their specific device
  - username: sensor_user
    topic: "commands/${clientid}/#"
    permission: sub

  # Sensors can publish to shared data topics with wildcards
  - username: sensor_user
    topic: "data/+/temperature"
    permission: pub

  - username: sensor_user
    topic: "data/+/humidity"
    permission: pub

  # ===== Camera User Rules =====
  # Cameras can publish video streams
  - username: camera_user
    topic: "video/${clientid}/stream"
    permission: pub

  # Cameras receive control commands
  - username: camera_user
    topic: "camera/${clientid}/control"
    permission: sub

  # ===== Automation User Rules =====
  # Automation can read all sensor data
  - username: automation_user
    topic: "sensors/#"
    permission: sub

  - username: automation_user
    topic: "data/#"
    permission: sub
