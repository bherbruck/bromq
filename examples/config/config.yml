# MQTT Server Configuration File
#
# This file is used to provision MQTT users and ACL rules.
# The configuration is synced to the database on every startup.
# This file is the source of truth for provisioned items (like Grafana provisioning).
#
# Environment variable interpolation is supported: ${VAR_NAME} or $VAR_NAME
# Reserved placeholders are preserved: ${username} and ${clientid}
#   - ${username} is replaced at runtime with the authenticated MQTT username
#   - ${clientid} is replaced at runtime with the MQTT client ID
#
# Usage:
#   ./mqtt-server -config config.yml
#   Or set CONFIG_FILE environment variable:
#   CONFIG_FILE=/etc/mqtt-server/config.yml ./mqtt-server

# MQTT Users (device credentials for MQTT connections)
# These are NOT dashboard admin users - they are for MQTT client authentication

  # Basic user with environment variable password
  - username: sensor_user
    password: ${SENSOR_PASSWORD}

# ACL Rules (topic access control)
# Rules reference users by username and define topic patterns with permissions
acl_rules:
  # ===== Sensor User Rules =====
  # Sensors can publish/subscribe to their own namespace using ${username} placeholder
  - mqtt_username: sensor_user
    topic_pattern: "sensors/${username}/#"
    permission: pubsub

  # Sensors can publish telemetry using ${clientid} placeholder (per-device isolation)
  - mqtt_username: sensor_user
    topic_pattern: "telemetry/${clientid}/data"
    permission: pub

  # Sensors can subscribe to commands for their specific device
  - mqtt_username: sensor_user
    topic_pattern: "commands/${clientid}/#"
    permission: sub

  # Sensors can publish to shared data topics with wildcards
  - mqtt_username: sensor_user
    topic_pattern: "data/+/temperature"
    permission: pub

  - mqtt_username: sensor_user
    topic_pattern: "data/+/humidity"
    permission: pub

  # ===== Camera User Rules =====
  # Cameras can publish video streams
  - mqtt_username: camera_user
    topic_pattern: "video/${clientid}/stream"
    permission: pub

  # Cameras receive control commands
  - mqtt_username: camera_user
    topic_pattern: "camera/${clientid}/control"
    permission: sub

  # ===== Automation User Rules =====
  # Automation can read all sensor data
  - mqtt_username: automation_user
    topic_pattern: "sensors/#"
    permission: sub

  - mqtt_username: automation_user
    topic_pattern: "data/#"
    permission: sub

  # Automation can publish commands to all devices
  - mqtt_username: automation_user
    topic_pattern: "commands/#"
    permission: pub

  # Automation can access building systems
  - mqtt_username: automation_user
    topic_pattern: "building/hvac/#"
    permission: pubsub

  - mqtt_username: automation_user
    topic_pattern: "building/lighting/#"
    permission: pubsub

  # ===== Admin Device Rules =====
  # Admin devices have full access
  - mqtt_username: admin_device
    topic_pattern: "#"
